# Hack the North Project

Project Name: wheresmybus
Devpost Link:https://devpost.com/software/wheresmybus

Description: 
With WheresMyBus?, users just need a phone number to access accurate estimates of when a bus will be arriving at their stop. 
The user would simply send the stops' id/number (which is located on the bus stop sign) to the WheresMyBus? number. 
The service would then send back a real-time estimate of all the upcoming bus arrival times for that stop.
